```
vendored(""packaging"")
vendored(""packaging.version"")
```

In `sys.modules`, `pip._vendor.packaging` is correctly connected to the debundled `packaging`, while `pip._vendor.packaging.version` is not, as the latter is `__import__`ed from the existing `pip._vendor.packaging` module. That results in the same issue as https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5429 - `pip._vendor.packaging.version.Version` and `packaging.version.Version` cannot be compared.

This patch attempts to fix this issue by skipping `__import__` from the vendored name. This is safe because `vendored()` is called only when `DEBUNDLED = True`, and vendored libraries are already deleted as per [debundling instructions](https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/master/src/pip/_vendor/README.rst#debundling).

byte-strings on Little Endian or vice versa.

The TestEncoding.test_auto_decode_utf_16_le test was failing on Big Endian
systems, such as Fedora's s390x builders. A similar test, but with BE BOM
test_auto_decode_utf_16_be was added in order to reproduce this on a Little
Endian system (which is much easier to come by).

A regression test was added to check that all listed encodings in
utils.encoding.BOMS are valid.

 Internally it switches ColorizedStreamHandler to StreamHandler if
 this flag is detected.

* Fix lint errors

 * not sure it makes the code more readable though ...

* Fix typo

* Choose logging class before assigning

 * As requested per review
 * Make the code shorter and easier to follow

* Be polite to followers, add commas

* Add functional test for the --no-color output

* Better detection of windows

* Fix fragile tests - can't trust script --quiet

 * The version found in Travis-CI does not respect this flag

   add the flag --quiet (script from util-linux 2.26.2).

(Distutils, Setuptools, ...) recorded them.

Unfortunately, at least Setuptools doesn't record them in a
deterministic order in the case of a directory being installed, as it
uses os.walk to find the list of files.

We could fix all those underlying tools to record their files in a
deterministic order in all situations. But fixing it once here in Pip
for all tools is certainly simpler and more future-proof.

This makes the installation more reproducible, and therefore more
verifiable.

this PR is to have it build a wheel, which is stored in an ephemeral
cache directory, used for installation, and then discarded.

We can't cache it permanently based on the path/URL, because the code
there might change, but our cache wouldn't be invalidated.

The issue is that the setup and teardown of the test environment takes a
long time, and in order to reuse the same test environment, we must
perform install/uninstall cycles to test different URL and path formats.

A better approach might be to generate `FSPkg` using a function that
writes the `setup.py` and `__init__.py` files to a new directory. The
test packages would be easy to generate and save the uninstall time.

For now, we reduce the number of URL/path formats tested, since the
previous test coverage was even more limited.

the versions list of a package, but that version is not necessarily the
latest. For example, `SearchCommand.search()` may return the following
(tested with JFrog Artifactory PyPI repo):

    pypi_hits = command.search(args, options)

    [{'_pypi_ordering': 1,
      'name': 'testlib',
      'summary': 'Test library.',
      'version': '1.0.5'},
     {'_pypi_ordering': 0,
      'name': 'testlib',
      'summary': 'Test library.',
      'version': '1.0.3'}]

`pip.commands.search.transform_hits()` preserves the order of versions:

    hits = pip.commands.search.transform_hits(pypi_hits)

    [{'name': 'testlib',
      'summary': 'Test library.',
      'versions': ['1.0.5', '1.0.3']}]

`pip.commands.search.print_results()` uses the last version in the list:

    pip.commands.search.print_results(hits)

    testlib (1.0.3)  - Test library.

Expected result:

    testlib (1.0.5)  - Test library.

`print_results()` uses `highest_version()` already to compare the
installed version with the latest found version (for installed
packages). Same function is used in this fix to show the latest
versions of all found packages.

properly.

The `SETUPTOOLS_SHIM` compiles and executes a `setup.py` for an editable
file link. The form of the command opens directly the path from
`file:<path>` links while also setting `cwd=<path>`. This may break
relative paths where the dependent project is at a different depth in a
source tree from the referenced requirement. In that case, the opened
file `<path>` relative to the relative path `<path>` will not align,
leading to an `OSError`.

information that can be set on a simple repository. This allows pip to
ignore any release or file that would not be compatible with the current
Python version even before trying to download and install this version.

Relevant extract of pep 503 at the time of this writing.

    A repository MAY include a data-requires-python attribute on a file
    link. This exposes the Requires-Python metadata field, specified in PEP
    345 , for the corresponding release. Where this is present, installer
    tools SHOULD ignore the download when installing to a Python version
    that doesn't satisfy the requirement. For example:

    <a href=""..."" data-requires-python=""&gt;=3"">...</a>
    In the attribute value, < and > have to be HTML encoded as &lt; and &gt;
    , respectively.

This can mostly be used to, for example, mark a new sdist of a new
package version as requires-python >3.4, and not  fail to install or
upgrade on users systems.

This will require extra patches to PyPI-legacy and warehouse to be
usable. Though releasing a version of pip that understand this feature
is necessary to have wide adoption at the time when these metadata get
actually published.

requirements file are missing a hash, installation fails with a message
suggesting the appropriate lines that should be copied into the
requirements file.

This worked fine for requirement specifiers such as `requests==2.9.1`,
however for packages specified by URL, the resultant output did not
match that originally in the requirements file.

For example a requirements file containing:
```
--require-hashes
https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/archive/19.4.5.zip
https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/archive/v2.9.1.zip#egg=requests==2.9.1
```

Would result in:
```
Hashes are required in ...
    unknown package --hash=sha256:399347c0a7272fb70b45d5840027c372f...
    requests==2.9.1 --hash=sha256:89839b1698243e232780d1fc808ae8730...
```

Now the original URL line is correctly shown:
```
Hashes are required in ...
    https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/archive/19.4.5.zip --hash=...
    https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/archive/v2.9.1.zip#egg=requests==2.9.1 --hash=...
```

downstream was patching out our bundled copies anyways and it would
provide a smoother experience when people upgraded their pip inside
of their system.

However, if we just use OpenSSL's CAFile then we're broken on systems
like Debian which currently ship a broken CAFile configuration. If
we just use OpenSSL's CAPath then we're broken on systems like CentOS
and Fedora that currently are shipping a broken OpenSSL CAPath.

So basically, none of the major distributions seem to be capable of
shipping an OpenSSL that isn't broken, so we're going back to relying
on our own CA bundle exclusively.

to restore the ability to overwrite distutils installed packages.

It is not elegant, but some projects (such as OpenStack's devstack)
rely on overwriting packages installed via the system package manager.
These packages can't be removed because they are dependencies for
parts of the base system, but many of the things devstack needs to run
requires later dependencies.  For historical reasons it's not easy to
fix this into a virtualenv, etc, all at once.

If distributions move to setuptools based packages, this problem might
fix itself.

In the case of this bug, pip's dependencies were unvendored while
requests did not have its dependencies unvendored. This caused a
problem where urllib3 was receiving a
pip._vendor.requests.packages.urllib3.Retry instance but expecting a
requests.packages.urllib3.Retry instance. Since they aren't the same,
urllib3 assumed it was an integer and we received a TypeError as
described in the bug report.

Creating aliases for urllib3 and it's submodules should fix this
(similar to how we specify six, six.moves, six.moves.urllib, packaging,
packaging.version, and packaging.specifiers)

In the case of urllib3's contrib modules, we need to be careful to
import them to prevent against future headaches without causing
an ImportError for the cli if the optional dependencies are not
available.

wheel will be implicitly broken because they will have dynamically
adjusted the install_requires inside of their setup.py. Typically
this is done for things like Python version, implementation, or what
OS this is being installed on. We don't consider cache directories
to be OS agnostic but we do consider them to be Python version and
implementation agnostic. To solve this, we'll force the cached
wheel to use a more specific Python tag that includes the major
version and the implementation.

packages that take a very long time to build (e.g. scipy) the user gets
no indication that anything is happening for a very long time (e.g. tens
of minutes), and is likely to get frustrated and hit Control-C. This can
also create issues for automated systems that kill jobs that don't
produce occasional output (e.g. Travis-CI).

This commit implements an idea discussed here:

  https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2732#issuecomment-153215371

where we put up a spinner that rotates whenever the underlying build
produces output. I tried it on scipy, and it the experience was quite
pleasant! It spun around, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, and then
there was one uncomfortable pause for ~1 minute while a very gnarly C++
file got compiled, but that's okay because it was actually providing
accurate feedback.

It looks like:
```
  Running setup.py install for scipy ... /
  Running setup.py install for scipy ... -
  Running setup.py install for scipy ... \
  Running setup.py install for scipy ... done
```
or if the command has non-zero return code, or an exception is raised,
you get:
```
  Running setup.py install for scipy ... /
  Running setup.py install for scipy ... -
  Running setup.py install for scipy ... \
  Running setup.py install for scipy ... error
```

This would occur when, for example, installing from a requirements file that references a certain hashed sdist, a common situation.

As of pip 7, pip always tries to build a wheel for each requirement (if one wasn't provided directly) and installs from that. The way this was implemented, InstallRequirement.link pointed to the cached wheel, which obviously had a different hash than the index-sourced archive, so spurious mismatch errors would result.

Now we no longer read from the wheel cache in hash-checking mode.

Make populate_link(), rather than the `link` setter, responsible for mapping InstallRequirement.link to a cached wheel. populate_link() isn't called until until prepare_files(). At that point, when we've examined all InstallRequirements and their potential --hash options, we know whether we should be requiring hashes and thus whether to use the wheel cache at all.

The only place that sets InstallRequirement.link other than InstallRequirement itself is pip.wheel, which does so long after hashes have been checked, when it's unpacking the wheel it just built, so it won't cause spurious hash mismatches.

`os.path.expanduser('~/path')` returns `//path` rather than `/path` when
`HOME=/`. This affects pip when `os.path.expanduser('~/.cache/pip')` is
expanded to `/\\\\.cache/pip`. Although `HOME=/` is probably uncommon on
most Linux systems, it is extremely common in Docker images.

Close #1175. * Add --require-hashes option. This is handy in deployment scripts to force application authors to hash their requirements. It is also a convenient way to get pip to show computed hashes for a virgin, unhashed requirements file. Eventually, additions to `pip freeze` should fill a superset of this use case.
  * In --require-hashes mode, at least one hash is required to match for each requirement.
  * Option-based requirements (--sha256=...) turn on --require-hashes mode implicitly.
  * Internet-derived URL-based hashes are ""necessary but not sufficient"": they do not satisfy --require-hashes mode when they match, but they are still used to guard against transmission errors.
  * Other URL-based requirements (#md5=...) are treated just like flag-based ones, except they don't turn on --require-hashes.
* Complain informatively, with the most devastating errors first so you don't chase your tail all day only to run up against a brick wall at the end. This also means we don't complain that a hash is missing, only for the user to find, after fixing it, that we have no idea how to even compute a hash for that type of requirement.
  * Complain about unpinned requirements when hash-checking mode is on, lest they cause the user surprise later.
  * Complain about missing hashes.
  * Complain about requirement types we don't know how to hash (like VCS ones and local dirs).
* Have InstallRequirement keep its original Link around (original_link) so we can differentiate between URL hashes from requirements files and ones downloaded from the (untrustworthy) internet.
* Remove test_download_hashes, which is obsolete. Similar coverage is provided in test_utils.TestHashes and the various hash cases in test_req.py.

purelib & platlib to any ""install-dir"" specified by the user in
setup.cfg.  This code is used when we are installing wheels.

The problem with this is that distutils is *always* setting
""i.install_lib"" -- even when the user specifies nothing.  This has the
result of unconditionally setting purelib == platlib.

On some systems this results in .so's from the wheel getting installed
into /usr/lib/python2.7 (purelib) rather than /usr/lib64/python
(platlib).  Because distribution-packaged libraries have installed
their .so into platlib, we can now have a situation where the new
pip-installed library is picking up an old .so from the distro package
... with predictably bad results.

This takes the approach of checking the configuration to see if the
user has overridden install-dir and only resetting the paths if they
have.  The override case is covered by existing test-cases.

This patch makes '-e file:///path#egg=name' function similarly to
'file:///path#egg=name' and '-e git+URL#egg=name'.  If #egg=name is not
defined, it returns None and the package becomes an unamed requirement,
which constraints will not parse but in the case of a requirement will
later be processed and determined.

in order to attempt to automatically alias normally installed
dependencies as our vendored dependencies. This turned out to be
fairly fragile, so instead we'll manually patch sys.modules to
trigger the aliasing.

As part of this, we also drop support for the
PIP_NO_VENDOR_FOR_DOWNSTREAM environment variable because it was
never fully supported and now that we have wheel caching, actually
using it could possibly trigger a bad wheel to be cached. The new
mechanism requires some light patching by downstream to opt into
the mechanism, so they can also easily remove all of the files
in pip/_vendor/ except for __init__.py.

is_download in req_set indicates we're downloading to a user specified
directory - and has nothing to do with deleting the extracted tree.
The actual thing we want to use to control that is the removed
--no-install parameter.

Additionally for wheels we only want to mark the unpacked tree for

by building an sdist and then unpacking it instead of doing
`shutil.copytree`. `shutil.copytree` may copy files that aren't included
in the sdist, which means that:

1. If those files are large, a `pip install` could take much longer than
it should.

2. Folks that are using `python setup.py install` to test their package
are not fully testing it, because it may copy over files that wouldn't
be there if they built and sdist and installed that.

So this method building an sdist is both more accurate and faster.

1. When `pip install` succeeds, it's still printing a lot of output from
   the package's setup.py. The average consumer of Python packages, when
   they do `pip install lxml`, probably doesn't care to see a bunch of
   output about:

   - copying files to a `build` directory
   - installing and running Cython
   - compiling C code

   This is noise to most when the `pip install` succeeds. It's useful to
   see all the output when the install fails, which is the subject of #2
   below. On success, the output is now very clean with 5 short lines:

       $ pip install lxml
       Collecting lxml
         Using cached lxml-3.4.2.tar.gz
       Installing collected packages: lxml
         Running setup.py install for lxml
       Successfully installed lxml-3.4.2

2. When there's an error from `pip install`, it's annoying to have to
   scroll through 2 different copies of the failure output (especially when
   one is filtered and one is unfiltered so one might have stuff that the
   other doesn't). This makes it not print the filtered version so that
   there is just the unfiltered version and nothing is repeated.

an installation can get newer certificates simply by updating their

bundling certifi we're essentially reverting this behavior, forcing
people to update their copy of pip to get a new copy of certifi to
update their certififcaates. Instead we'll use a globally installed
certifi if it's available which will allow people to upgrade their
certificates as requests intended.

so that it was always checked regardless of download success. This is
problematic when downloads fail in a way that will make the hash check
fail. For example, downloading zero bytes so that a zero byte file is
hashed. When this happens the hash mismatch is reported to the user and
not the underlying network issue that was run into.

Fix this by removing the try finally block completely so that early
errors are bubbled up and reported to users.

It's useful to distinguish between downloading from PyPI or from an
internal devpi server, for example. In the latter case, it is useful to
see the full URL, to know which index pip is downloading from.

* Modified the `pip/commands/search.py` to make use of the

* Properly initialized options for testing `SearchCommand`:

base64 encoded pickled files that represented an installed pip. It
extracted these files into the temporary location and then executed
that unpacked pip in order to install pip and setuptools from PyPI.

This changes it so that get-pip.py is the bootstrap script and it
contains inside it a base64 encoded zipped copy of pip. It will
decode this base64 encoded zip file, write it to a temporary
location, and then add it to the sys.path. It will then run
the bootstrap function which will extract cacert.pem from the
zip file, write the cacert.pem to a temporary location, and
finally install pip using the copy of pip within the zip
using the temporary cacert.pem to validate the TLS connection to
PyPI.

This should represent no change in behavior for users of get-pip.py
however it should push the trouble of the bulk of the implementation
onto the Python install instead of trying to do this ourselves.

The one important behavior change for packagers is that this will
no longer package an *installed* pip, but will instead package the
version that has been checked out. I believe this is more obvious
and what a packager would expect to happen anyways.

dashes) *before* the config dictionaries are merged.

Otherwise, if you set a value in a config file and via an environment
variable both the dash separated key (from the config file) and the
underscore separated key (from the environment variable) end up in the
config dictionary. Usually this doesn't matter because the latter key
comes after the former when the dictionary is iterated over. But in
cases where the two config keys hash to the same value module the size
of the dictionary, the order is reversed and the wrong value takes
precedance.

For instance with 'index-url' there's no problem:

    >>> repr({'index-url': 1, 'index_url': 2})
    ""{'index-url': 1, 'index_url': 2}""

But with 'no-index', the value from the config file overwrites the
value from the environment variable:

    >>> repr({'no-index': 1, 'no_index': 2})
    ""{'no_index': 2, 'no-index': 1}""
