The parameter group_regex is used to group the test_ids. By passing a regex
string with the parameter the test partitioner will match the regex to the
test ids and then group by the result. In the case a test id does not match
the regex it will be put in a default group. These groups are then used for
scheduling the partitions. Each test groups is scheduled together so that all 
tests in a group are run together on the same partition. For the purposes of 
scheduling the groups the sum of all test ids in a group is used to schedule 
the whole group in a partition.

Known Issues
============

 * AutoTimingTestResultDecorator inserts current clock data into the
   stream, which makes predictable testing of times hard. So in a couple
   of places I circumvented it.

 * AutoTimingTestResultDecorator causes 'testr last' to report a
   different time to 'testr load' for the same run (generally ~0.1s
   longer). This means that the time delta is a bit useless. Removing
   the AutoTimingTestResultDecorator fixes this. Haven't dug into
   exactly why.
