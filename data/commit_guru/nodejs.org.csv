I. In the recent days we've fixed the non-English character generation
of anchor link by directly using the pure HTML tags, however a better
way is:

1) Check whether the current title has the comment symbol (<!---->).
2) If yes, just take the characters out of the symbol as the anchor
link's name, with the real text as the title behind it.
3) If not, just do replacements as what it used to be.

The advantage is that you can keep the anchor link the same as what
it is in the English version or define by yourself. What's more: It's
much more flexible when your change the level of titles, compared with
https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/2028.

II. Add '--fix' for local test to automatically fix some simple
formation typo errors.

refers to any of its Mac platforms as Macintosh. Also, in a number of
places, nodejs.org refers to macOS and Macintosh on the same page.
This change updates the site for consistency, preferring macOS in all

is to revise a single proper noun, with one exception:
`locale/ko/download/package-manager.md` appears to spell ""Macintosh"" in
Korean, and I am unequipped to handle that change.

This commit does not update blog entries, which refer to the Macintosh
installer by name. Blog entries seem fixed and ephemeral, though it
would be trivial to update them all. Going forward, blog entries
should identify the installer for macOS as the ""macOS Installer"", as

Te content of the 'development' page was outdated and written in a way too long
and complex manner. Currently, there are two documents, explaining the
overall governance and contribution process in detail:

- https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md
- https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Both documents go into a level of detail that IMHO aren't suitable for a general
""get involved"" text like on the website, so the following sections were added:

- Where to get general help (linking Node.js help repository)
- Code contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)
- What are 'Collaborators', who appoints them and how can I become one

Other changes:

- Removes menu item from all translations
- Fix links and minor layout issues in 'get-involved/index' (ca, en, es, uk)
- Remove note about last Fall's collab summit's Code + Learn (en)
