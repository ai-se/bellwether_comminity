When the module path contains a colon, it will conflict with this import way and a `flask.cli.NoAppException` will be raised. A file path on a Windows system may contain a colon followed by a slash.
So we solved this problem on Windows by ignoring the colon followed by a
slash when we split app_import_path.

order to support sending unicode characters. Tested on both Firefox and
Chromium under Linux.

This adds unidecode as a dependency, which might be relaxed by using
.encode('latin-1', 'ignore') but wouldn't be as useful.

Also, added a test for the correct headers to be added.

Previously, using a filename parameter to send_file with unicode characters, it
failed with the next error since HTTP headers don't allow non latin-1 characters.
Error on request:

This addresses #1467. The init in the subclass

`EnvironBuilder` via keyword args.

This should provide the default environment capability

`kwargs` in `FlaskClient.open` or `FlaskClient.environ_base`
if passed into the init.

* Update minitwit readme

* updates the instructions for running

* Fixes for updating the minitwit example

Makes the flaskr app easier to run, ex. workflow:
- pip install --editable .
- export FLASK_APP=flaskr.flaskr
- flask initdb
- flask run

Testing is also easier now:
- python setup.py test

* Fixed an import error in flaskr/tests

- the statement `import flaskr` caused errors in python3
- `from . import flaskr` fixes the issue in 2.7.11 and 3.5.1

* Better project structure and updates the docs

- Re-factors *flaskr*'s project structure a bit
- Updates docs to make sense with the new structure
  - Adds a new step about installing Flask apps with setuptools
  - Switches first-person style writing to second-person (reads better IMO)
  - Adds segments in *testing.rst* for running tests with setuptools

* Remove __init__.py from tests

- py.test recommends not using __init__.py

* Fix testing import errors

initialising the Jinja2 environment) and the server is then started with
