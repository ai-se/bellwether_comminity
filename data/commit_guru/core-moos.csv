I'm currently migrating to MOOS V10 (long overdue, indeed). I found a change in MOOSCore/Core/libMOOS/Utils/include/MOOS/libMOOS/Utils/MOOSMemoryMapped.h at line 107, where O_RDONLY has become O_RDWR. This class is used for playing back .alog files. As most of our historical .alog files are read-only (for good reason), opening them fails.

I undid the change, and everything seems to work fine now.

Perhaps you want to apply this change to your code?

Thanks, Arjan.

I think I've found a glitch in the MOOSDB source code. This applies to MOOS-IvP 14.7.1 (the latest on moos-ivp.org) with asynchronous clients support active. The problem is more evident when the code is cross compiled for ARM (at least from my experience).
The effects of the bug are MOOSDB not starting correctly and continuously dumping error messages regarding a problem in listening for connection from the TCP socket. Actually the output is as follows:

# ./MOOSDB
------------------- MOOSDB V10 -------------------
Hosting  community                ""#1""

Exception Thrown in listen loop: Error Listening To Socket. Operation not supported
Exception Thrown in listen loop: Error Listening To Socket. Operation not supported
Exception Thrown in listen loop: Error Listening To Socket. Operation not supported
(goes on endlessly)

The cause was identified in an *UDP* socket asked to listen for connections....
After digging a bit in the code I found the problem in XPCGetProtocol. The constructors of this class are concurrently called by two threads, one creating a TCP socket, the other an UDP one. The class has proper mutex locking, BUT uses, as inner data member, the ret value of the system function ""getprotobyname()"", which returns info about protocols as a pointer to a statically allocated struct (thus creating a non protected shared data between the two concurrent instances).
Making local copies (in XPCGetProtocol) of the protocol name and number solved the problem.

Please let me know if you agree with my analysis.

Best ragards,

  library, on OSX < Mavericks, GNU's libstdc++ is the default.
- This commit adds the option USE_LIBSTDCPP on OSX >= Mavericks which
  by default is OFF, but when enabled forces CMake to use the GNU
  libstdc++ when compiling.  This is important as MATLAB still links
  against libstdc++ on Mavericks and thus any MEX files will be linked
  against libstdc++ and libstdc++ & libc++ are API, but not ABI
  compatible.
- This patch also makes the default build type Release unless the user
  specifies their own build type.

a) wc subscription
b) subscription
c) notify
would not result in the notification invoking the primed wc subscription. The solution proposed here moves the logic of looking for new wc matches into Notify when the DBVar is being written for the first time.  Originally it was in GetorMakeVar() which was a funny place for it and made understanding what was going on slightly harder than it should be.

Yep that was it.  It seems that registering for a variable before it is ever posted to will prevent pShare from picking it up as a wildcard share.

Hmm... good question. You can verify this hunch quickly by locally editing
ivp/src/uPokeDB/PokeDB.cpp to block out that registering:

void PokeDB::registerVariables()
{
#if 0
  unsigned int i, vsize = m_varname.size();
  for(i=0; i<vsize; i++)
    m_Comms.Register(m_varname[i], 0);
#endif

  m_Comms.Register(""DB_UPTIME"", 0);
  m_Comms.Register(""DB_TIME"", 0);

}

I tried uTimerScript and that worked fine.  I'm pretty sure other
applications work as well, because I was using wildcard shares to bridge
back VIEW_* from the vehicle previously.  Could it somehow be related to
uPokeDB subscribing to the variable before it publishes to it?

I am working out of the moos-ivp trunk, though with the core-moos and
essential-moos git devel branches.  I rebuilt uPokeDB today against
the

I was attempting to run MOOS on a slower omap processor and encountered
a race condition between threads in the MOOSDB.  The result is that the
tcp server in the MOOSCommServer would be set as UDP instead of TCP
resulting in the listen call continuously throwing an 'operation not
supported' exception and putting the MOOSDB into a busy loop.

I traced the problem to the non-threadsafe getprotobyname and
getprotobynumber calls in
core-moos/Core/libMOOS/Comms/XPCGetProtocol.cpp.  The solution is to
change the calls to the thread-safe reentrant versions, getprotobyname_r
and get getprotobynumber_r.  The Linux Man page for getprotobyname_r
provides a good example of the changes necessary.

I don't have any questions, just providing a heads up in case anyone
encounters this issue before it's fixed on trunk.

Thanks,

Here's a potential gotcha that seems to have been introduced in MOOS V10.

Inside CMOOSApp::Configure()

We now have:

 //are we expected to use MOOS comms?
 m_MissionReader.GetConfigurationParam(""UseMOOSComms"",m_bUseMOOSComms);
 m_bUseMOOSComms = !m_CommandLineParser.GetFlag(""--moos_no_comms"");

Whereas before we had:

 //are we expected to use MOOS comms?
 m_MissionReader.GetConfigurationParam(""UseMOOSComms"",m_bUseMOOSComms);

The problem comes when an app developer sets m_bUseMOOSComms=false in his
constructor. It gets flipped back to true by the absence of ""--moos_no_comms"" on the command line.

Can (should??) the commandline parser be made to instead take no action
if the command-line switch is absent? Rather than interpreting its absence
as a preference?

cheers,
Mike

Hi all,

I received a report recently that compiling some MOOS applications (in this case, from the moos-ivp-iver tree) in Visual Studio 2010 on Windows resulted in the following compile time error from the use of CMOOSCommClient::Notify() to post to MOOSdb variables:

==================================================
D:\Sandbox\moos-ivp-iver\src\iOceanServerComms\iOceanServerComms.cpp(232): error C2666: 'CMOOSCommClient::Notify' : 2 overloads have similar conversions
2>          d:\sandbox\moos-ivp\moos-2375-oct0611-modified\core\mooslib\MOOSCommClient.h(91): could be 'bool CMOOSCommClient::Notify(const std::string &,void *,unsigned int,double)'
2>          d:\sandbox\moos-ivp\moos-2375-oct0611-modified\core\mooslib\MOOSCommClient.h(83): or       'bool CMOOSCommClient::Notify(const std::string &,const std::string &,double)'
==================================================

The error is kind of ugly to read, but the compiler is complaining about the two function signatures of Notify() in CMOOSCommClient being vague.  The user resolved the situation by explicitly declaring the content string of the posted-to MOOS variables as std::string type, but this bloats the code, in my opinion.

You end up going from...

m_Comms.Notify(""MOOSDB_VARIABLE"", ""FOO"", dfTimeNow);

...to...

std::string sTmp = ""FOO"";
m_Comms.Notify(""MOOSDB_VARIABLE"", sTmp, dfTimeNow);

...just to remove the compile time error on Windows.

Has anyone seen this Visual Studio compile time error before that has a better solution?

Thanks, in advance.

Hi -

Best solution would be for MOOS to explicitly define

bool CMOOSCommClient::Notify(const std::string &,const char *,double);

Until that happens that you can save yourself the extra code by
explicitly calling the std::string(const char*) constructor:

m_Comms.Notify(""MOOSDB_VARIABLE"", std::string(""FOO""), dfTimeNow);

-t

Hi all,

I received a report recently that compiling some MOOS applications (in this case, from the moos-ivp-iver tree) in Visual Studio 2010 on Windows resulted in the following compile time error from the use of CMOOSCommClient::Notify() to post to MOOSdb variables:

==================================================
D:\Sandbox\moos-ivp-iver\src\iOceanServerComms\iOceanServerComms.cpp(232): error C2666: 'CMOOSCommClient::Notify' : 2 overloads have similar conversions
2>          d:\sandbox\moos-ivp\moos-2375-oct0611-modified\core\mooslib\MOOSCommClient.h(91): could be 'bool CMOOSCommClient::Notify(const std::string &,void *,unsigned int,double)'
2>          d:\sandbox\moos-ivp\moos-2375-oct0611-modified\core\mooslib\MOOSCommClient.h(83): or       'bool CMOOSCommClient::Notify(const std::string &,const std::string &,double)'
==================================================

The error is kind of ugly to read, but the compiler is complaining about the two function signatures of Notify() in CMOOSCommClient being vague.  The user resolved the situation by explicitly declaring the content string of the posted-to MOOS variables as std::string type, but this bloats the code, in my opinion.

You end up going from...

m_Comms.Notify(""MOOSDB_VARIABLE"", ""FOO"", dfTimeNow);

...to...

std::string sTmp = ""FOO"";
m_Comms.Notify(""MOOSDB_VARIABLE"", sTmp, dfTimeNow);

...just to remove the compile time error on Windows.

Has anyone seen this Visual Studio compile time error before that has a better solution?

Thanks, in advance.

It seems there is a small problem when a process connects to the MOOSDB and registers for mail FOOBAR (when the last post to FOOBAR was long ago).

While it does indeed receive mail on FOOBAR, it is missing the source auxilliary information. Subsequent new mail on FOOBAR contains the auxilliary information, but it appears that MOOSDB does not hold onto this info.

It seems two additional book-keeping lines were missing in MOOSDB.cpp.
I'm attaching a revised MOOSDB.cpp with the two new lines denoted by ""Added by mikerb"". If you agree with the changes, would you consider including them in the latest version?

cheers,
Mike

pthread_attr_t attr;
pthread_attr_init(&attr);
pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);

...and changed the next line from:

int Status = pthread_create( &m_nThreadID,NULL,CallbackProc,this);

to

int Status = pthread_create( &m_nThreadID,&attr,CallbackProc,this);

The effect is that memory allocated for the thread on invocation of
pthread_create() is (automatically) returned to the system after
the thread finishes. On my system this was 8 MB per thread and if
one just starts and finishes some threads often enough the system
would sooner or later run out of memory.

On a side note: pthread_join() in CMOOSThread::Stop() seems to always
return with an error. As far as I understand, it should really not be
necessary to call it at all. I took the liberty to comment it out,
but I think it should/could be permanently removed.

This variable is used in CMOOSCommClient::Close() to make sure that
the CMOOSCommClient::ClientLoop() has really finished, and these are
the respective lines:

while(m_bConnected )

changes to

while(m_bClientLoopIsRunning)

Note that just before this waiting (with timeout) while-loop
m_ClientThread.Stop() is called - so it makes sense trying to wait
until this thread has actually ceased to exist, which is indicated
by the above (new) flag.

Without this flag, it could happen that the object is destructed,
but the thread is still running, eventually trying to access
member variables (that no longer exist)....
