$ adb devices

subsequent diff which introduces an IRC client to stetho-sample.

sockets but rather interpreting the messages at a higher level before
sending them to NetworkEventReporter.

does indeed have a path to the GC root that isn't already covered by the
many exclusions present in LeakCanary for legitimate Android use cases.
This is essentially a known flaw in LeakCanary in which unknown path to
GC roots are assumed to be leaks even if they are indeed consistent with
the normal object lifecycle (like in our case the strong reference is
removed when the activity is destroyed).

Working around this issue is trivial however and does indeed have the
effect of making our code look less suspicious of leaks in the first
place.

server.  The dumpapp client (python) used unsigned integers where the
server (Android/Java) used signed integers due to a limitation in
DataInput/OutputStream not supporting unsigned 32 and 64-bit types
(technically this could be done with readLong & 0xffffffffff though).
The critical fix comes in when sys.stdin.buffer.read reaches EOF whereby
the client tried to pack -1 in an unsigned int which is not obviously
not possible.  Since the server was always expecting this to be signed, simply
correcting the client causes the problem to go away.

""<this_element>"" and ""Accessibility Properties"". With this commit
descriptors are able to themselves choose what the selector name should
be and how their various properties should be distributed among the
selectors.

This enables an element to have styles such as:

layout {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

props {
  text: ""Hello World"";
}

Due to this requiring an added property in StyleAccumulator I chose to
also take this commit to split up styles from computed styles which are
two separate concepts but up until now have been handled the same. A
style may be `width: 100%` while a computed style would be `width:
320px`.

to manually locate a database by its file name and didn't
properly handle deduplicating multiple databases with the same name.  As
we expanded flexibility we failed to address the possibility (nay,
likelihood) that this will occur and it would create very confusing
results for users.

This diff doesn't address the confusion in the UI (two database entries
of the same name can still occur) but it internally makes it possible to
treat them as separate databases and track their filenames separately.
It also makes it relatively straightforward to fix the uniqueness of the
user visible naming by introducing a ""context"" parameter to
DatabaseDescriptor which would be used in the case of name ambiguity.

This diff addresses concerns raised in #366 and #367.

bundle the jars directly if targeting 6.0 in an effort to phase out its
usage more aggressively.  Unfortunately, Stetho depended on HttpClient
for a crude HTTP server implementation to facilitate dumpapp and the
Chrome DevTools protocol.

This diff adds an HTTP server for general purpose usage within Stetho
but also heavily modifies dumpapp to no longer use HTTP at all.  This
became possible late in dumpapp's development when a framing protocol
was developed to support stdout/stderr.  This framing protocol made it
easy to use pure sockets and to further mimic the command-line paradigm.

The legacy HTTP support for dumpapp remains but in limited capacity
(does not support stdin and cannot do streaming stdout/stderr output).
A warning is produced when the old script is used.

Stetho combines both the new binary dumpapp protocol with the DevTools
HTTP/WebSocket protocol in a single socket and simply sniffs the first
few bytes from the client to determine how to handle the remainder of
the stream.  This was done for simplicity and performance so that just
one server would need to be set up when Stetho initializes.

mobile implementations choose to do it because payloads tend to be quite
large on clients and servers these days are easily made to support it.
This diff simply makes it so that Stetho will show the decompressed
payload, but still report the compressed payloads size to the UI.

Note that this only affects stetho-urlconnection and stetho-okhttp.
Other modules must manually implement this as it is not possible given
the existing API contract to do it transparently.

Some gotchas:

* The names of style properties shown are not copied verbatim from the names of fields in the `View` class, but are translated to a format that Chrome understands. For example, `View` has a field called `paddingLeft`, but in order for that to be rendered correctly in Chrome, it needs to be transmitted as `padding-left`.

* Default values are not transmitted, unless they are of an enum type, in which case they are *always* transmitted.

* Due to inconsistencies between annotations present on certain Android SDK versions, some fields that are enums are not translated into their string representation. This is unfortunate, but the only way to get around it is by special-casing those one or two cases, which is probably not viable long-term.

Some things that would be nice to add in the future:

* Inferring some way the element's style 'class', so that the styles aren't all aggregated into one blob. Same with style inheritance.

* In Chrome you can edit these CSS properties, but here you can't. Maybe a future project? Would probably relatively simple to add.

Style inspection of Stetho's 'Settings' button:

What works:
 - basic JS expressions
 - evaluatied statements preserve their states (can create a variable and it will persist between successive calls)
 - return types are properly expanded by chrome's inspector
 - binding of android's Context (passed as `context`)
 - binding for classes: `System.gc()` is `Packages.java.lang.System.gc()`
 - console redirection with `console.log()`
 - `importPackage()` to import all classes under a java package
 - `importClass()` to import a single class
 - binding variables
 - binding functions

of relying on an ugly reflection trick known to work only on JB+ (and of
course not future proof).  There's a slight overhead increase in
Stetho.initialize as a result, but the timings added indicate it is
still very small (1-2ms on my Nexus 5).

The mechanism for tracking activities is partially exposed via
ActivityTracker which has a manual add/remove method which allows
developers to add support for pre-ICS even by hooking their own
application onCreate/onDestroy events just like HierarchyViewer's
ViewServer used in the past.

UNIX abstract domain socket) which has a very heavy-handed
implementation of LocalSocketImpl#flush which polls/sleeps waiting for
the kernel buffer to become empty.  This behaviour in practice reduces
observed throughput of dumpapp (using either the buffered stdout or
stderr) to between 300 and 600KB/s despite adb being capable of ~5MB/s
on the same device.

This workaround involves blocking the final flush call to the socket
output stream.  This still drains the local Java buffer as originally
intended, but does not ask the kernel to drain its buffer (and block
doing so).  This kernel draining behaviour is entirely unnecessary for
our purposes and presumably for everyone else as it appears to be added
for some special purpose hack in the Bluetooh implementation.

convenient configuration which excludes the stetho core module from
release builds but still allows the developer to ship network
instrumentation from stetho-urlconnection.

In particular, stetho-sample uses a separate Application instance for
debug builds only that initializes Stetho.  The trick is further
described here:
http://littlerobots.nl/blog/stetho-for-android-debug-builds-only/

For stetho-urlconnection, we allow it to be used unconditionally in
debug and release builds where only the debug builds actually include
stetho.  Stetho's presence is detected at runtime in and the internal
methods turn into no-ops accordingly.  This approach is intended to be
source and binary compatible with previous releases.  It is also
expected to efficiently pass the verifier on both Dalvik and ART without
spamming unresolved method/class warnings.  This is achieved by way of
the Holder class proxy in accordance with:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization-on-demand_holder_idiom

Note that the strategy for stetho-okhttp is slightly different since the
hooking exists inside okhttp itself.  Because of this, callers can
arrange for a simple `src/debug/...` style solution to hook their
initialization of OkHttp much like how stetho-sample configures Stetho
itself.

     list on update.  This memory is reapable when all peers are

  2. On setDOMStorageItem failure, force refresh the UI state so that it

from the UI until Network.responseReceived is delivered with the actual
Page.ResourceType is given.  This works fine when there is a small delay
between requestWillBeSent and responseReceived, but if the delay widens
significantly, the Inspector UI will discard the record and fail to show
it no matter how progress is made after that point.

This can be demonstrated by adding significant timing delays in network
events (such as by using iptables to slow down or stop traffic entirely)
or just adding delays in NetworkEventReporterImpl.

compression on response bodies for both supported HTTP stacks
(HttpURLConnection and okhttp).  There are caveats associated the
HttpURLConnection implementation due to the fact that under the hood the
Android implementation attempts to handle modern concepts like
compression automatically for you, which prevents inspection of the
compressed payloads in many common cases.  okhttp doesn't have these
issues and allows us to inspect both the compressed and uncompressed
sizes.

Also add a new test to okhttp to verify end-to-end integration with
okhttp interceptors by using the mockwebserver library provided by
okhttp to power its own internal tests.  This test also serves as proof
that compression handling works properly.

about simplified integration but it has the nice side effect of
centralizing usages of NetworkEventReporter so that we could more easily
revision this API if we needed to.

Some semantic changes were applied to the sample as a result of this
refactor (in particular, requestWillBeSent is now delivered after
URL#openConnection) though these were done explicitly to simplify
integration and should not have any functional impact.  See
http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/01/17/HttpURLConnection for
context on exactly how messed up the HttpURLConnection API really is.

Also fixed a bug with calling disconnect after the HttpURLConnection
instance was disposed.
