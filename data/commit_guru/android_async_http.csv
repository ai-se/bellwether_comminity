This is now fixed.

- A full implementation of Cancel behaviour with granular cancellation time (downloads are now chunked so can be canceled before completion).
- Progress and retry notification
- Fixed some small stability issues (unhandled exception, connection issues on network switch).
- SyncHttpClient fixes to use any handler (all handlers can now be forced into sync mode)
- Cleanup of JsonHttpResponseHandler.java removing all superfluous helper methods

* sweetlilmre/master:
  Added FileAsyncHttpResponseHandler based on: https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http/pull/134
  Big download fixes: Removed unnecessary buffer copy (should allow for larger downloads and helps to combat VM heap constraints) Wrapped allocation in OutOfMemory handler, current behaviour will signal the GC and retry. This _sometimes_ works if GC has a change to run
  Reworked Json handler to parse json on the download thread in the failure case and fixed the messaging to be consistant updated javadocs
  Refactored AsyncHttpResponseHandler.java code base to facilitate a single base class and to use binary as the base response format Refactored dependent AsyncHttpResponseHandler.java classes: BinaryHttpResponseHandler.java, JsonHttpResponseHandler.java Added new ResponseHandler: TextHttpResponseHandler.java Cleaned up exception handling, added missing exception handling and mofified RetryHandler behavior to be more robust Moved handler to separate class to avoid leaks in AsyncHttpRequest.java Added PROGRESS and RETRY messages
