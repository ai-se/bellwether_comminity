However, rasa_core expects a `str`. When a user queries the conversations for a specific user id, his input is processed as `str`. Rasa returns an empty conversation list, as the tracker only contains entries for the user id as `int` but not as `str`. **Proposed Changes**::
- By casting the user id to a `str`, we force all user ids to be handled as `str`. Note, that we do not have to parse back the user id to a `int` when sending message back to Telegram, as the library accepts user ids as `str` and `int`.
- `MongoTrackerStore` is the only `TrackerStore` which might be affected by this as it would not be able to find conversations which have been saved using `str` user ids. Therefore, we try querying with an `int` user_id and in doing so update the sender_id to the now used `str` version.
