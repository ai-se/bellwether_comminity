the original controls provided by Doom's setup.exe.

However, the reality is that nowadays most people play with the WASD&mouse
arrangement (or something similar) and are unlikely to be using the mouse
to move forwards. So it makes more sense if we reserve the main mouse
dialog for ""action"" buttons (fire/use) and move the ""move forward"" button
into the more buttons dialog. This also makes the more buttons dialog match
the arrangements for keyboard and gamepad controls.

As part of this, also tweak the mouse button minimum width so that it has a
consistent size that can describe high-numbered mouse buttons (eg.
""BUTTON #10"").

interface which could use any number of decode libraries to support a
given sound format [1]. Thus, the flags passed over to Mix_Init() were
changed from per-library (e.g. MIX_INIT_FLUIDSYNTH) to per-format
(e.g. MIX_INIT_MID). Since there was no way to specifically request
support for native MIDI (or, actually, any MIDI at all) before (i.e.
there was only MIX_INIT_FLUIDSYNTH), we pass zero as a flag over to
Mix_Init(), which in turn turns it into a noop. Seems harmless, as it
turned out it wasn't even required to call Mix_Init() for SDL2_Mixer
version 2.0.1.

This also fixes building under Travis CI which runs an Ubuntu release
that still has an older SDL2_Mixer library (xenial: 2.0.1+dfsg1-1).

Dammit! I think I have made a mistake when I added initialization for
the floor->type and floor->crush fields in EV_BuildStairs() in commit
12b7676e7deb1e290be5128137014523227750a8.

I was under the assumption that, because `10 != false`, it means the
same as `true` -- but this is wrong. The code in question explicitly
checks for `(floor->crush == true)` and not merely `(floor->crush)`,
i.e. its value being unequal to zero.

This will have lead to a desyncing TNT demo reported in
https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/55558-final-doom-demos-complevel-4/?do=findComment&comment=1961738

I need an extra pair of eyes this time. Guys, please double-check
against the code in PrBoom+. The relevant piece of code starts here:

to checking the current working directory, also look in the directory
where the program executable is located.

To give some context for why I'm adding this: apparently there's a small
number of users who do something very unpleasant that I'd really prefer
they didn't: they ""install"" Chocolate Doom into Steam by replacing
dosbox.exe from their Steam installation of Doom with a renamed version
of `chocolate-doom.exe`. Yuck, I don't approve - it's a grotesque hack.

This works but it has a bug: Chocolate Doom picks up the Steam IWADs
from Windows registry keys. This means that it always starts doom2.wad,
and launching ""Ultimate Doom"" will actually launch Doom II. This solves
that problem, and while I don't approve of dumb Steam hacks, the change
itself is reasonable and it's an eminently sensible place to look for an
IWAD file.

S_StopMusic() has code that calls I_ResumeSong() if the music is
currently paused. However, S_Start() clears the paused state, which
prevents the call to I_ResumeSong() from occurring. I interpret this as
implying that the call to DMX's I_PlaySong() will resume OPL playback.

may get flipped - even across savegames - add a mobj flag to
explicitly mark sprites as flippable. Then, if an object is flippable
and not shootable (anymore) and its health value is odd (which, of
course, gets randomized) flip its sprite, else don't. This is even
safe across savegames without any further hassle.

This may get extended to further map things, e.g. projectiles or
decoration. Unfortunately, this means one step back in fixing #302,
because a monster's flags and health are reset as soon as it gets
resurrected. Anyway, this fixes #291, thanks @JNechaevsky.

under the most obscure conditions, this really adds to the robustness
of the engine and is highly appreciated!

So, I decided to remove this code. Why?
1) It fiddles around with IWAD maps! While at some point in the past I
might have considered this to be in line with the port's goal of
purism, I generally doubt this decision nowadays.
2) It may be safe for demo recording, but it fails upon demo playback,
because the demoplayback variable is unconditionally reset in g_game.c
before this code is called. It might be possible to fix this, but this
would be a bodge upon a bodge and I want to avoid changing the core
routines in g_game.c just for this.
3) There are PWADs available that fix these two issues and people are
encouraged to use them. It has also shown in the past that the
engine-side fixes were even counter-productive to the intent of these
PWADs.

acceleration that performance might be poor and to suggest toggling
force_software_renderer. However the check is not reliable: it can't
determine whether hardware acceleration is taking place on Linux, as
Mesa front-ends both hardware and software implementations.

We explored alternatives (checking SDL_GL_ACCELERATED_VISUAL) but
these proved similarly unreliable.

On Linux, GLX offers glxIsDirect, but this is of no use where GLX
is not available, including (I think) Linux framebuffer or Wayland.

Rather than continue to mislead people, delete the test and warning.

is the most Vanilla-friendly possible solution (in terms of code line changes,
that is). It is also savegame compatible with previous code.

Two caveats:
(1) This registers up to three times more buttons for lines
with switch textures than Vanilla code, so in theory this might break
the buttonlist[] limit. This has been mitigated by removing the
MAXBUTTONS limit in two former commits.
(2) This may lead to the same sound getting emitted more than once by the same
line. This is mitigated by the S_StartSoundOnce() function that I
introduced in an earlier commit.

Thanks to @JNechaevsky for spotting this glitch in the Vanilla code
and @bradharding and @jeffdoggett for presenting alternative
approaches -- that I like less than mine, nevertheless. :p

does not apply during demos because crispy->singleplayer is false.

would also oscillate for sectors with variable light levels and even
extinguish (!) when sectors go full dark. This was unacceptable. Now,
texture highlights are always brightmapped with full intensity.

that I have in doom/r_bmaps.c, originating from Doom Retro, and quite
some questions arose:

- The value in the ""game"" field is often different from the rightmost
  column in your table, but I guess this is mostly harmless as long as
  the few exceptions that we discussed earlier (i.e. SW2STON2 and
  SW2SKULL) are considered and as long as the TNT textures are only
  brightmapped in Doom 2.
- I had to change quite some brightmaps to get rid of stray green
  pixels, mostly by changes like greenonly1->greenonly2. I guess this
  is because I do leave Vanilla textures untouched in Crispy, whereas
  you clean them up in both Russian Doom and Doom retro, right?
  One exception: You brightmap SW2COMM with greenonly2, whereas I
  find that greenonly1 works just as well. Is this an oversight?
- Where can I find a map that uses the ZELDOOR texture? Does it even
  look good if brightmapped?
- In your list, you enumerate the SLAD2-SLADRIP3 animation sequence
  with 66-78, i.e. 13 textures, whereas I only handle 12 textures
  in the code.
- I want brightmaps for Chex Quest! ;)

the fluidsynth backend and recent versions of fluidsynth allow for
using soundfonts in SF3 format (which contain OGG compressed samples).

The midiproc process currently assumes that it is possible to remove
the temporary music file immediately after Mix_LoadMUS() has been
called, which is true if the music is rendered using Windows's limited
intrnal MIDI playback. However, when using an advanced backend like
fluidsynth, this file maybe locked by this library. Furthermore,
midiproc currently assumes that it is possible to override the
temporary music file as soon as Mix_HaltMusic() has been called which
is again not true if fluidsynth is used. In this case, this is only
possible after Mix_FreeMusic() has been called (and returned).
Additionally, we increase the time-out value after which we give up
waiting for the midiproc process to send an acknowledgement to 1s to
give it some time to load the fluidsynth library and a soundfont
(although 1s will still not be enough for soundfonts in SF3 format
which reportedly load up to the order of 10s!).

Rationale: When SDL_Mixer uses an external library (e.g. fluidsynth)
for music playback, this library may keep the temporary music lump file
open. This means that it cannot be overridden by the next attempt to
register another song. As a consequence, the same song is played over
and over again.

Instead, unregister a song as soon as it is stopped in midiproc and
let the main process wait until the unregistering is acknowledged.
Then it is the roght time to override the music lump file and play
a new song.

Thanks a lot to @Zodomaniac for his willingness and patience to
tackle this issue!

terms of demo and network sync) change since the beginning of the
project. o_O

Some background: Currently, ""singleplayer"" is a macro that checks
three global variables (demorecording, demoplayback and netgame). The
point is, it checks these variables multiple times per tic, but their
values only change very rarely. In general, we need to check this
variable each time a map starts (is it a demo?, is it a netgame?) and
each time a game ends.

I have come up with the following schema:

One check in d_main.c:D_DoAdvanceDemo(),
one check in g_game.c:G_DoLoadLevel() and
one additional check in g_game.c:G_DoPlayDemo().

G_DoNewGame() calls G_InitNew() which calls G_DoLoadLevel().
G_DoLoadGame() calls G_InitNew, see above.
G_DoPlayDemo() calls either G_DoLoadGame() or G_InitNew, see above,
but then sets demoplayback afterwards, so set crispy_singleplayer
again.
M_EndGameResponse() calls G_CheckDemoStatus() if demorecording is set
and D_StartTitle() which calls D_AdvanceDemo() which in turn leads to
D_DoAdvanceDemo() being called.
G_CheckDemoStatus() either returns from the game if timingdemo or
demorecording is set (or demoplayback and singledemo) or calls
D_Advancedemo(), see above.

So, everything should be safe with the checks being reduced down to
three and the variable remaining constant from then on to the next
check.

give a symbolic (string) name to each protocol version. This allows us
to define new protocol versions in the future while retaining
compatibility between different Chocolate Doom versions. It also allows
forks of Chocolate Doom to define their own protocols while retaining
the ability to connect to Chocolate Doom servers (and vice versa, for
Chocolate Doom clients to connect to forked servers).

When a client connects to a server, we send a list of protocols that are
supported. The server compares it to its own list of protocols and
selects a common protocol that will be used. The protocol is then sent
back to the client in a reply packet.

In order to do this, we must change the way that clients connect to
servers. Previously the client sent a SYN packet, and the server would
respond with an ACK packet. Instead, get rid of ACK packets and send a
SYN packet back instead. This also simplifies the state machine when
performing a connect. Since this is a fundamental change in the
protocol, change the magic number sent when connecting, but continue to
recognize the old magic number and send a reject message to old clients.

message when taking more than one screenshot, because when you are
viewing a screenshot you usually already know that it's a screenshot.
;)

I did this by introducing a new variable ""crispy_screenshotmsg"". This
variable is set to 2 when a screenshot has been taken. This value
means ""we have just taken a screenshot and the 'screen shot' message
will be shown from then next tick on"".

In the next tic, this variable is right-shifted in HU_Ticker to become
1 as soon as the ""screen shot"" message is written into the w_message
widget. This value means ""we are currently showing the 'screen shot'
message"". When a new message - e.g. a pick-up message - appears, this
variable is right-shifted again in the same function and will then
become 0. It will also get right-shifted to become 0 when the
message_counter runs flat before a new message has appeared. A value
of 0 means that we are currently not showing the 'screen shot'
message.

Now comes the interesting part: If a screenshot is taken while the
variable has value 1 this means we need to get active and remove the
'screen shot' message from the scene before saving the picture. To
achieve this we temporarily raise the variable value to 4 which means
""we are currently taking a screenshot and need to remove the 'screen
shot' message"". We do this using the same measures as introduced for
the crispy_cleanscreenshot feature. Once we have finished rendering
the scene we set the variable value back to 2 as usual.

This is probably not the most sophisticated solution, maybe I will
merge this variable and crispy_cleanscreenshot into a {short,short}
struct. But for now it serves the purpose and thus fixes #203, thanks
@Zodomaniac for the idea and discussion.

Demo recording is initiated from the command line, so the recording
starts with gametic 0. There is no other possible way to *record* a demo.

When demos are played back from the command line (i.e. by -playdemo or
-timedemo) they do also start with gametic 0 and everything remains in
sync. When demos are played back by the in-game demo loop, however,
they start at arbitrary gametics and we need to substract the gametic
at which the demo playback was started to remain in sync.

@JNechaevsky: This should make it possible to play back entire
speedruns by the in-game demo loop and thus perform a multi-hour
stress test. ;)

As it is now, you may *only* respawn using the dedicated ""respawn""
key, not the mouse of joystick. For this to change, I would have to
introduce a dedicated mouse button for ""respawn"". But this is
impossible, because it is not possible to assign the same mouse button
to different logical actions.

Sorry @Zodomaniac but it seems you have to get used to pressing the
""use"" button for respawn. :/

as a PWAD. However, for reasons that I don't understand, this IWAD contains
the lumps required to render the ""Episode Selection"" menu. Now, if you
have the NERVE.WAD extension available in your WAD search folder (I
have), this is automatically loaded alongside the PLUTONIA.WAD PWAD.

Up to and including map 9 all is fine, because P_SetupLevel() calls
W_GetSecondNumForName() on the lumpname and the additional levels from
NERVE.WAD get skipped in favour of the ones from PLUTONIA.WAD.
However, once MAP10 is reached, there is no level from NERVE.WAD
available that could get skipped. Instead, W_GetNumForName() falls
down to return MAP10 from PLUTONIA.WAD, which would be correct, but
W_GetSecondNumForName() skips this and returns the map from the
DOOM2.WAD IWAD instead. Needless to say that the demo desyncs from
this map onward.

All of this reminds me that I will have to rethink the criteria for
auto-loading NERVE.WAD and rendering the ""Episode Selection"" menu.

So, here it is, my port of DoomBSP's BLOCKMAP builder to become
Crispy's internal BLOCKMAP builder. This is the same code that id used
to create their IWAD maps!

On the downside, it is in the order of factor 250 times slower than
the previous implementation from MBF (measured with planisf2.wad: 43 s
vs. 0,18 s). But, hey, it procudes the exact same BLOCKMAPs as are in
the IWAD, it has its limits removed, it supports flipped levels
out of the box and it compresses quite well (between ~54% nominal size
for DOOM2.WAD MAP31 and MAP32 and ~92% nominal size for MAP05).

This is more important for me than mere speed. ;)

This is a slight tweak to the fix on #859. It shouldn't make much, if

extra RAM and gain a marginal improvement then I don't see any reason

cursor, even if the cursor is currently pointing outside of the game

It turned out that the logic to determine whether to grab the mouse was
trying too hard to be well-behaved. While we should release mouse grab
if the app loses focus (so the user can see their mouse cursor again and
click on whatever popup has appeared), we don't need to do the same just
because the mouse cursor is outside the game window's bounds.

This fixes #798. Thanks @CapnClever.

Well, once the sdl2-branch is merged, I plan to switch Crispy Doom to
truecolor rendering. This means that each pixel in the framebuffer
will have to be represented by a int32_t type instead of a single
byte. For this, a lot of functions have to get modified and it would
makes things considerably easier to just flip a single typedef. Apart
from the cosmetic change this will not make any difference for Choco,
but it will make maintaining my fork easier and allow for a smaller
interdiff.

Ths patch is by far not complete, but should do alright for Doom
already. I file this pull request in order to check the mood and ask if a
change like this would be accepted at all? It is absolutely no problem
if you decide against it!

read from this file with fread() will fail and the result variable
will not get set set. Since the result variable does not get initialized
either, saveg_read8() will return some ""random"" value.

However, as it turns out, the uninitlaized value of the result
variable isn't that random at all, but most often 0. Unfortunately, 0
has a specific meaning in the context of p_saveg.c, as it is the value
of tc_ceiling in enum specials_e. As a result, the tclass variable in
P_UnArchiveSpecials() will get interpreted as tc_ceiling and lead to
the construction of ceiling thinkers until Choco runs out of zone
memory.

What this little change does is initialize the result variable
returned by saveg_read8() to some arbitrary value that has no further
meaning in any of the enums in p_save.c. This will lead to Choco
erroring out with an ""unknown tclass"" message, which is consistent
with Vanilla. The actual tclass value may be different, but since it
is expected to be somehow ""random"" this isn't something I plan to
emulate any further at this point.

weapon sprites x-coordinate to render the weapon centered, because
this value is stored in savegames. The new implementation leaves the
actual coordinate value untouched and merely renders the weapon sprite
centered.

This may feel like a regression, because after firing the weapon swing
will continue at its actual position instead of the centered position.

the joystick which is configured. This has the downside of assuming
a static configuration; joystick indexes can change if devices are
plugged or unplugged.

SDL2 introduces the idea of Joystick GUIDs which can uniquely
identify a class of device, so use this as the primary configuration
variable instead; that way, if the number or ordering of joystick
devices changes, we will still use the same device. As GUID can only
identify a ""class"" of device (eg. ""Xbox controller""), we still keep
joystick_index around to try to differentiate between devices when
there are multiple identical devices connected.

In the future, we might want to fall back to using the
hardware-accelerated texture-based approach of the main rendering
stack (though this may seem like an overkill here).

However, it might be easier to take screenshots in the actual screen
dimensions with this approach (though I somehow remember that we
decided on 1600x1200 being the ideal solution that we should stay
with?).

music, it isn't sufficient anymore to assume that ""if it isn't MIDI,
then it must be MUS"". Reportedly, the mus2mid() function happily
converted anything that could be assumed to be faintly legit into
MIDI format -- even FLAC files which, of course, would refuse to play
after this conversion. Thus, we add back a check for the ""MUS"" header
which must be found at the beginning of a music lump in order to
identify it to be in MUS format. This check has been removed because
of the broken D_DM2TTL lump of DECA.WAD which begins with a ""PWAD""
header instead of ""MUS"". Apparently, Vanilla Doom didn't have this
check, but in the other hand only supported MIDI and MUS solely,
anyway.

https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/commit/784e848b326a6f8b0c1377fc7a1b3c5a945cb009

Sorry, D_DM2TTL lump of DECA.WAD, you won't play anymore, but you are
much too broken with your ""PWAD"" header for us to detect you as valid
music in MUS format. On the other hand, with this check added back,
all the other music that people throw at Crispy Doom will play
flawlessly.

For the future: could we define this (and the supporting stuff)

libtextscreen, since that is included/linked to by chocolate-*,
and not the other way around; but there is already some grey
area e.g. textscreen including doomkeys.h.

This now works as well as the sdl1 setup programs did, I think.
There are still some quirks and things which don't work at all
well if you wander off US-ASCII, just as with the sdl1 version.
I also suspect that the setup programs should respond to changes
in the vanilla_keyboard_mapping setting as part of fixing that.

nothing specific to E1M8b and not even to limit-removing or whatsnot.

```
Conversely, it is possible by loading a normal save and starting a
nightmare game repeatedly to continually halve the state durations,
making demons faster and faster. Of particular interest is the chase
state sequence (S_SARG_RUN1 to S_SARG_RUN8), where each of the
individual states that comprise it lasts only two tics. After two
halvings, their duration is reduced to zero, possibly resulting in an
infinite loop as the whole sequence can be looped an infinite amount
of times in a single tic. (This can happen if the demon is awake, but
cannot reach the player; for example, because a door has not finished
opening. Being unable to start attacking, it will continue to chase
forever without any delay, freezing the game as it cannot process
anything else.)

Closes #665.

The original commit enhanced the behaviour of Doom to make some of the
pseudo-random behaviour less predictable. Whilst this is a nice feature, it's a
feature that vanilla lacks: replaying a demo would result in those behaviours
(wipe, pitched sound effects) being identical each time. This is not the case
with the above feature.

It could actually be quite useful to ensure that such behaviours are
reproducible to fine-tune our emulation of e.g. Doom/Heretic/Hexen pitch
shifting. Perhaps in the future our testing will be enhanced to compare
multimedia output of Vanilla versus chocolate for demo playback, in which case
we would also need to have reproducibility here.

is x86 specific and only really makes sense for x86-based PC's with
compatible hardware.

For some architectures (e.g. ARM), ioperm, inb and outb do exist and are
detected by the configure script (via AC_CHECK_FUNCS(ioperm)), but their
use is inappropriate in these cases and should be avoided.

In some other scenarios, like when using a GNU toolchain + uClibc for
PowerPC, the build even fails with the following error:

  opl_linux.c:26:20: fatal error: sys/io.h: No such file or directory

That is so because ioperm() is exported by uClibc and gets detected by
configure, which enables the ""Linux"" driver via definition of
HAVE_IOPERM, but in practice 'sys/io.h' is missing for ppc (inb/outb is
not implemented, and the call to ioperm() would return EIO anyway).

So, besides testing for HAVE_IOPERM, also test if either __i386__ or
__x86_64__ are defined before enabling this OPL driver.

Although the intention is to have configure check and use PACKAGE by
default if it's available, thus requiring the user to pass an option
only if PACKAGE must NOT be used, there are times when the opposite
might be desired (i.e. the user wants to indicate PACKAGE MUST be used).
Moreover, allowing --with-PACKAGE and behaving as if --without-PACKAGE
had been specified is in itself quite confusing.

Fix that by testing the result of 'with_PACKAGE' in configure.ac and

I have not done any serious measurements, yet, but the improvements

This way, the screen still looks gritty and pixelated but the numbers

grittier, we could increase the UPSCALE macro to e.g. 3, but I have
not found any any differences using higher numbers than that. Anyway,

that are searched for data files via the XDG_DATA_HOME and

To make Chocolate Doom a good citizen, use these directories to
determine some of the locations in which to look for IWAD files. This
includes /usr/share/games/doom, which is absorbed under the default
value of the XDG_DATA_DIRS variable. We also now support the alternative
~/.local/share/games/doom as a user-writeable path in the user's home
directory that doesn't require root privileges.

this is problematic because the array must be realloc()ed to
increase its size with each load of a new WAD. If data from one of
the WADs has already been cached in memory, the zone memory system's
user pointer can end up pointing at freed memory.

Therefore, any modification to lumpinfo[] had to be carefully
controlled - see previous commit d5b6bb70919f that applied an
attempted fix. However, this fix did not fix loading using the
merging command line parameters, which change lumpinfo[] in far more
complicated ways.

Instead, this fixes the issue in a more fundamental way. lumpinfo[]
is now an array of pointers to lumpinfo_t structs, disconnecting
their memory locations from their location in the lumpinfo[] array.
It's now possible to change or rearrange the array in any desired
way without the zone user pointers getting out of sync.

This also includes a minor change to define a lumpindex_t type for
representing lumpinfo[] indices, to make the WAD API more literate.

Thanks to Fabian Greffrath for identifying that the bug was still
present when using the merge parameters. This fixes #442 (again).

Doom's PCX screenshots are 320x200, which is in the wrong 16:10 aspect
ratio and doesn't match the 4:3 aspect ratio that the screen is 
supposed to be displayed at. Within the game we stretch the screen to
the correct aspect ratio, but screenshots are saved wrong.

When the user has made the choice to use PNG screenshots instead of 
PCX, they've already made the decision to break with Vanilla 
compatibility, so there's an opportunity to fix the aspect ratio. 
To correct aspect ratio losslessly it is necessary to scale up by 5x 
(horizontally) / 6x (vertically). However, PNG files have much better
compression than PCX so this isn't really an issue - a 1600x1200 PNG

aspect correction applied.

1600x1200 is the smallest size necessary to do this losslessly:
each pixel is repeated 5 times per row and each row is repeated
6 times.

The resulting shots are still smaller than their PCX equivalents.

There are many places in Hexen where the int is set to 0, and it is assumed that the pointer is then NULL. If the int is smaller than the pointer (e.g. on 64-bit systems, where the int is 32 bits and the pointer is 64), then this can leave a non-NULL pointer to nowhere. This patch ensures that the int and pointer are the same size. This fixes a bug where killing an enemy with the Wraithverge causes a segfault.

The advantage of the additional intermediate surface is that by first
upscaling by an integer factor and then linear downscaling again into
the renderer window we can preserve the pixelated look of ""nearest""
scaling but at the same time benefit from the refined ""linear"" scaling
for the rendering of static objects like the status bar numbers.

mean the same thing.

need it in I_UpdateSoundParams, so I haven't brought those bits
back.

aspects of the same bug:
 * Alexandre-Xavier reported that when running at full framerate, the
   single -devparm dot would flash (#374);
 * Linguica reported on Doomworld that Chocolate Doom appeared to be
   rendering each tic twice (see:
   http://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1340374 ).
 * Harha reported performance problems when running in a VM, which
   may be related (http://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1374315 ).

Chocolate Doom long ago (41cdd5785305a) changed the main loop code so
that it does not freeze in network games when tics stop being
received; the idea is that it should always be possible to activate
the menu to quit. Vanilla Doom allows this too, but only after 20 tics
of waiting in TryRunTics() for network data to be received; the menu
can be used but is deathly slow. So the loop was changed to wait for
only 1 tic instead.

However, there was an error in the logic for the check. In a single
player game, when time has advanced to the point of being ready to
execute another tic, NetUpdate() will build the new ticcmd_t;
TryRunTics() was returning immediately; according to the timer, at the
exact same time as tic generation, we had also been spinning in the
loop for a whole tic and it was time to render a new frame.

The end result was that each tic transition would trigger two frames
to be rendered: the previous frame, and the new frame. Clearly this is
not what is intended.

To fix the problem:
 * Refactor the blocking loop in TryRunTics() so that we only bail out
   of the function after checking that the loop's exit condition has
   not just been satisfied (also to eliminate an unnecessary call to
   I_Sleep() between ticcmd_t generation and execution).
 * Increase the delay before we bail out to 5 tics rather than just 1.
   This is still much less than the 20 used in Vanilla Doom but is
   low enough to keep the menu responsive. A higher bar should ensure
   that this bug can't reoccur, even in multiplayer where the clocks
   can be adjusted for sync.

This fixes #374. Thanks to everyone involved in reporting the different
aspects of it.

at the time I didn't understand what it was or how it was supposed
to be used - it seemed like cruft left over from Doom's development.

It is actually a potentially useful feature for level authors when
developing their maps. See here: http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Reload_hack

The reload hack is a relatively obscure feature of limited usefulness
nowadays, but nonetheless a technical curiosity that ought to be
preserved in Chocolate Doom.

The reimplementation here is a lot cleaner than the original version
from the source release: W_Reload() is based on a call to W_AddFile(),
we don't reopen the reload file every time we want to read a lump,
and we include a check in W_AddFile() that we are not trying to use
the hack on more than one PWAD file.

This fixes #539.

that are missing a newline character at the end of the file (which
might have been a common sickness to DOS editors).

This is, because DEH_GetChar() returns -1 at EOF and DEH_ReadLine() in
turn immediately returns NULL if the result of (DEH_GetChar() < 0),
regardless of the content of the readbuffer. It only returns a pointer
to the content of the readbuffer if DEH_GetChar() returns '\n' which
is, however, impossible if there is no such character before the file
ends.

Now DEH_ReadLine() only returns NULL if the readbuffer is empty at the
end of the file and returns a valid pointer else.

(I_VideoBuffer) which was scaled and stretched by software routines
into a paletted SDL_Surface (screenbuffer) which had the dimensions
of the selected video mode and was then blit to the screen surface.

Now, we have an intermediate 320x200 32-bit RGBA surface that we blit
our 8-bit paletted 320x200 pixel buffer to. This surface is then loaded
into a texture that is scaled and stretched into the window or full
screen by means of hardware rendering.

The advantages are:

1.  Rendering is much faster, since we make use of the graphic hardware's
    texture scaling capabilities instead of scaling and stretching each
    pixel by software routines.

2.  Window sizes and fullscreen modes are not restricted to certain
    dimensions (i.e. multiples of 320x200 or 320x240 or 256x200,
    respectively) anymore. The graphic hardware can scale the texture
    into any given geometry and it still looks decent.
2a. We don't need to change the video mode at all in fullscreen mode.
2b. We don't need to adjust the video mode anymore when resizing the
    game window.

There are still a lot of TODOs left:

- The chocolate-setup tool must get adapted accordingly. That is,
  ""Full screen"" turns into a single yes/no question without ""Screen
  mode"" selection anymore and ""Window size"" could get turned into a
  pre-populated list of multiples of 320x240 (or 320x200 is aspect
  ratio correction is disabled) up to the current desktop resolution.
- Really get rid of the software scaling and stretching routines. So
  far, they are merely commented out in the source code.
- In this context, get rid of the concept of screen_mode_t, now that we
  can render the game into any given geometry.
- Find a way to circumvent the 320x200 32-bit RGBA buffer and directly
  load the 320x200 8-bit paletted buffer into the texture? This seems
  to be currently limited by SDL (or even the hardware itself)?
- Bring back I_BeginRead() and I_EndRead() do draw the disk icon? Will
  anybody miss this?
- Get window resizing more cleany. Maybe restrict to multiples of
  320x200 (or 320x240 for aspect ratio correction) for the benefit of
  a better rendering quality? But this would oppose one of the main
  benefits of hardware rendering! Decrease forced delay between
  changing the window size and clearing the window content.
- Turn scaling quality selection into a config / command line option.
- General clean up, remove obsolete code, improve comments.
- Maybe default to 640x480 as the initial window resolution. The
  320x200 window tends to get lost under my mouse cursor. ;-)

WADs that added new textures with names like these: the game would
exit on startup with a message like:

  R_InitTextures: Missing patch in texture SKY3GOLD

Amazingly this bug was not noticed because most of the patches in
the Hexen IWAD file have short names of 7 characters or less. The
only exception I noticed was SKYWALL2 which maps to SKYWALL,
another patch, hiding the bug.

ML_TWOSIDED flag set but are missing a second sidedef. Although this
merely fixes a mapping error, I decided to re-introduce it, since
I consider its removal a regression. However, I have found
a demo-safe way to fix this now: Instead of removing the flag entirely,
the line in question is simply rendered as if it was one-sided, so the
change is only in the renderer.

Moreover, if the sidedef does not have a midtexture, it is rendered
transparently, as in Vanilla or Chocolate Doom. This fixes
impassable fake glass as in OTTAWAU.WAD [1] while at the same time fixing
the HOM gaps in the walls in NOVA.WAD map 30 [2] and retaining demo
compatibility with challenj.wad.

by the engine. Also, fixing them is a rather drastic deviation from
Vanilla behaviour.

But, more importantly, some mapping errors are demo-critical. However,
due to the order in which variables are set in p_setup.c, it is
impossible to conditionally enable them with one of the ""usual
suspects"" variables, e.g. demorecording, demoplayback, usergame.
Instead, I had to introduce a new global variable that was once set,
but never reset. So, one ended up with two differently set-up levels
depending on whether the demo loop has been entered from the start
screen or not. Instead of fixing this in each possible location in the
code, I decided to remove the fixes entirely.

Doom IWADs to be played properly with Freedoom. Chocolate Doom detects
mission packs (pack_tnt/pack_plut) based on the file name. However, the
Freedoom: Phase 2 IWAD contains the textures for all three Doom2-format
IWADs, so can be used to play MegaWADs like Plutonia 2 that were
designed to be played with plutonia.wad.

Because mission pack detection is done based on filename, freedoom2.wad
is handled the same as doom2.wad (a sensible default). But this means that
when playing using a mod like Plutonia 2, the wrong level name is shown
on the automap screen (along with eg. intermission text). To fix this we
need a way to manually override the mission pack. -pack allows this to
be done. It's kind of tedious that this has to be done manually but at
least it can be done.

Thanks chungy for the bug report/suggestion. This fixes #449.

lump has been loaded (and cached) from a previous WAD. This
manifested when playing using the Freedoom IWADs and also loading
a PWAD at the same time. The Freedoom IWADs have DEHACKED lumps
that are loaded from within the IWAD file.

The ultimate cause (thanks to Fabian Greffrath for uncovering it)
is that lumpinfo is realloc()ed after each new WAD load to store
the lumpinfo_t structures from the new WAD. If a lump has been read
and cached from a previous WAD file, it may end up having an invalid
'user' pointer that points to somewhere in the old lumpinfo[] array,
not the new one.

I think this bug was masked because realloc() will often not move
data if the previous location can simply be extended. The bug was
discovered when loading BTSX as a PWAD, probably because it's a
large WAD that contains a lot of lumps, and forced a move during
realloc.

This was a red herring. The game is actually playable with as less as
5 MB of heap memory. However, there is an issue with the memory region
occupied be the DEHACKED patch being Z_Free()'d when the lumpinfo[]
array has been realloc()'d in the mean time. This is simply less

has been broken for a long time. The mysterious ""fudge factor"" that I
had to apply to tempo calculations is actually completely unnecessary:
the byte-swapping in the MIDI_GetFileTimeDivision() function was being
done wrong, so the time division being used by the OPL MIDI code was
completely wrong. Presumably the multiply by 260 was close enough to an
8-bit bitshift that it worked okayish, but large enough time division
values would overflow a single byte and screw up.

This fixes long-running OPL playback problems in a number of WADs, most
notably Alien Vendetta. This *really* fixes #352.

This didn't work in Chocolate Doom because of some changes made
to the G_InitNew code before the source release. Actual decompilation
of that function in Vanilla Doom shows that the episode/map sanity
checking is not present:

http://pastie.org/8140437

There is at least one known WAD (2002ado) that has a map on E5M1
that is playable in Vanilla, and this stops that map from being
possible to play. Comment out that code because it obviously

track that is never turned off. If this is not reset when the track
loops, there is a continuous (and annoying) drone sound throughout
the next iteration of the song. Some information is here:

http://www.doomworld.com/vb/source-ports/66802-the-d-ddtblu-disease/

This changes the mus2mid code to generate an ""all notes off""
controller event at the start of the MIDI track. This is specifically
done at the start and not the end of the track because otherwise the
looping of tracks like D_RUNNING is affected.

Thanks to a whole host of people for help on this: @plumsinus for
reporting the bug, @bradharding for devising a fix as part of Doom
Retro, and Quasar for feedback and his own fix to the Eternity Engine.

   entirely why it was required but I don't think it is any more.
 * Remove ""You should have received a copy of..."" text from copyright
   header. This refers to the old 59 Temple Place address where the
   FSF headquarters used to be located and is no longer correct.
   Rather than change to the new address, just remove the paragraph
   as it is superfluous anyway. This fixes #311.

when the boundaries of the map were reached. This is because the code
to move the background was done in calls to AM_Drawer(), which is
fundamentally a bad idea. Some old commented-out code shows that this
was previously done in AM_Drawer (same location that scrolls the map
itself), but it was moved. Move it back.

   for the doom2.wad shipped with the BFG Edition) check for the presence
   of DMENUPIC (which is exclusive to both classic IWADs shipped with the
   BFG Edition). The M_GDHIGH lumps, however, are incompatibly modified
   in *both* IWADs.
3) Move the check for the missing TITLEPIC lump to the place where it
   becomes actually crucial, i.e. D_DoAdvanceDemo() and make it independent
   of the (bfgedition) check. So, PWADs still have a chance to provide their
   own TITLEPIC lump.
